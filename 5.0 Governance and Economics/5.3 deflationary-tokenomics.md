# Deflationary Tokenomics

## **Purpose**

A **transaction fee-burning mechanism** reduces the total supply of GRD over time, creating scarcity and incentivizing
long-term holding. This deflationary model complements the Pure PoS consensus by aligning validator rewards with network
health.

## **Workflow**

### **Step 1: Transaction Submission**

1. **User Initiates Transfer**:
    - Example: Alice sends 100 GRD to Bob.
2. **Fee Calculation**:
    - **Gradium Network (Native GRD):**
        - Burn amount = `100 * 0.03% = 0.03 GRD`.
        - Transaction fee = `0.1 GRD` (base fee) + `0.03 GRD` (burn).
    - **BEP-20 Bridged GRD:**
        - Burn amount = `100 * 3% = 3 GRD`.
        - Transaction fee = `0.1 GRD` (base fee) + `3 GRD` (burn).

### **Step 2: Fee Burning**

1. **Burn Execution**:
    - The burned tokens are sent to the unspendable `0xdead` address.
2. **Supply Update**:
    - Total supply decreases by the burned amount in the block header (for native GRD).

## **Economic Impact**

### **Scarcity Mechanics**

- **Native GRD:** Burning **0.03% per transaction** removes approximately **315,000 tokens annually**, assuming **10
  million daily transactions**.
- **BEP-20 GRD:** With a **3% burn rate**, a much faster supply reduction is expected compared to the native token.
- **Value Appreciation:** Reduced supply combined with fixed demand creates **upward price pressure**.

### **Validator Alignment**

- Validators **prioritize efficient transactions** to maximize fees.
- Earn **0.1 GRD** per transaction but lose **burned GRD**, encouraging network optimization.
