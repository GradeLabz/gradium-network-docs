# Deflationary Tokenomics

## **Purpose**

A **transaction fee-burning mechanism** reduces the total token supply over time, creating scarcity and incentivizing
long-term holding. This deflationary model complements the Pure PoS consensus by aligning validator rewards with network
health.

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| Burn Rate             | 0.03% of transaction value             |  
| Burn Address          | `0x000000000000000000000000000000dead` |  
| Total Supply Tracking | Updated on-chain every block           |  
| Initial Supply        | 1,000,000,000 tokens (placeholder)     |

## **Workflow**

### **Step 1: Transaction Submission**

1. **User Initiates Transfer**:
    - Example: Alice sends 100 tokens to Bob.
2. **Fee Calculation**:
    - Burn amount = `100 * 0.03% = 0.03 tokens`.
    - Transaction fee = `0.1 tokens` (base fee) + `0.03 tokens` (burn).

### **Step 2: Fee Burning**

1. **Burn Execution**:
    - The burned tokens (`0.03`) are sent to the unspendable `0xdead` address.
2. **Supply Update**:
    - Total supply decreases by the burned amount in the block header.

# Validator Incentives

Validators earn **0.1 tokens** as a base fee but lose **0.03 tokens** through burning, aligning their incentives with
network efficiency.

## Economic Impact

### Scarcity Mechanics

- **Supply Reduction:** Burning **0.03% per transaction** removes approximately **315,000 tokens annually**, assuming *
  *10 million daily transactions**.
- **Value Appreciation:** Reduced supply combined with fixed demand creates **upward price pressure**.

### Validator Alignment

- Validators **prioritize efficient transactions** to maximize fees.
- Earn **0.1 tokens** per transaction but lose **0.03 tokens** via burning, encouraging network optimization.
