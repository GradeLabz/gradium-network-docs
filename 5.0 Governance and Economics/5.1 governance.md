# Governance

## **Purpose**

The governance layer enables stakeholders to **propose, vote on, and implement protocol changes** securely. It uses *
*Rainbow**, a multivariate quadratic signature scheme, to ensure quantum-resistant authentication of votes and
proposals.

---

## **Why Rainbow?**

### **Algorithm Overview**

- **Type**: Multivariate quadratic (MQ) digital signature scheme.
- **Security Foundation**: Based on the hardness of solving **systems of quadratic equations** over finite fields, a
  problem resistant to quantum attacks.
- **NIST Standardization**: Part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Project’s **Round 3 candidates** (Category:
  Digital Signatures).

### **Quantum Resistance**

- **Shor’s Algorithm Immunity**: Multivariate cryptography does not rely on number-theoretic problems vulnerable to
  quantum attacks.
- **Compact Signatures**: Smaller signatures compared to other post-quantum schemes (e.g., SPHINCS+).

---

## **Workflow: Proposal Submission and Voting**

### **Step 1: Proposal Creation**

1. **Stakeholder Input**: A governance proposal (e.g., parameter adjustment, protocol upgrade) is drafted.
2. **Proposal Hashing**: The proposal is hashed using **SHA-3-256** to create a digest.

### **Step 2: Proposal Signing**

1. **Rainbow Signature**:
    - The proposer signs the digest with their **Rainbow private key**.
2. **Signature Generation**:
    - Rainbow generates a compact multivariate signature using polynomial equations.

### Step 3: Proposal Submission

- The signed proposal is broadcast to the network and stored in a governance smart contract.

### Step 4: Voting

#### Voter Authentication

- Stakeholders sign their votes (e.g., "Yes/No/Abstain") with their Rainbow private keys.

#### Vote Aggregation

- Votes are collected and batched into a Merkle tree for efficient verification.

### Step 5: Tallying and Execution

#### Signature Verification

- Votes are verified using stakeholders’ public Rainbow keys.

#### Quorum Check

- Proposals pass if they meet predefined thresholds (e.g., >50% approval from staked tokens).

#### Execution

- Approved proposals are automatically executed via the blockchain’s runtime upgrade module.

| Verification Speed      | ~2,000      | ~1,000    |

## Key Management

- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Store private keys for high-value stakeholders.
- **Multi-Signature Support:** Combine Rainbow with FALCON for multi-party governance decisions.

## Security Considerations

### MQ Problem Hardness

- Best-known attacks on Rainbow-III require solving ≈2^128 equations.

### Signature Forgery

- Mitigated by using SHA-3 for proposal/vote hashing.

### Sybil Attacks

- Prevented by weighting votes by staked tokens.

## Performance Comparison

| Algorithm   | Signature Size | Key Size | Quantum Resistance | Signing Speed (ops/sec) |
|-------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| ECDSA       | 64 bytes       | 32 bytes | ❌                  | ~50,000                 |
| SPHINCS+    | 8,080 bytes    | 32 bytes | ✅                  | ~1,000                  |
| Rainbow-III | 164 bytes      | 157 KB   | ✅                  | ~500                    |

## Challenges and Mitigations

### Large Key Sizes

- **Mitigation:** Use key compression (e.g., structured seeds for key generation).

### Slow Signing

- **Mitigation:** Optimize equation-solving with GPU acceleration.

### Voter Participation

- **Mitigation:** Implement delegation mechanisms for passive stakeholders.
