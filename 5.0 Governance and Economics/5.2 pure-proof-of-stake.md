# Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS)

## **Purpose**

The Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism replaces energy-intensive mining with a **quantum-secure, stake-based
validation system**. It ensures decentralization while resisting Sybil attacks and quantum threats through cryptographic
innovations like **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** and **SHA-3-based randomness**.

## **Workflow**

### **Step 1: Validator Onboarding**

1. **Stake Tokens**:
    - A user locks tokens in a staking contract to become a validator.
    - Minimum stake: 1,000 tokens (adjustable via governance).
2. **Key Generation**:
    - Generate **Dilithium keys** (public/private) for block signing.

### Step 2: Epoch Randomness

#### VRF-Based Selection

Validators compute a **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** output using **SHA-3** to determine block producers for the
epoch.

#### Weighted Sampling

Validators are chosen with probability proportional to their stake.

---

### Step 3: Block Production

#### Block Creation

Selected validators package transactions into blocks and sign headers with **Dilithium** private keys.

#### Finalization

The **GRANDPA finality gadget** ensures irreversible block confirmation after **2/3 approval**.

---

### Step 4: Rewards and Penalties

#### Rewards

Validators earn **80% of transaction fees + block rewards (new tokens).**

#### Slashing

Malicious validators lose **10% of their stake** for attacks (e.g., double-signing).

## Quantum-Secure Components

### Dilithium Signatures

- Replaces **ECDSA/SR25519**
- Resistant to **Shorâ€™s Algorithm** due to **LWE/SIS lattice hardness**

### SHA-3 VRFs

- Ensures randomness is **unpredictable** even to **quantum adversaries**
