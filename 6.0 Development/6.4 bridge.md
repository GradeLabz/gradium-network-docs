# Quantova Network Bridge

## Secure Cross-Chain Transfer of GRD Tokens

The **Quantova Network Bridge** enables seamless and secure transfer of the native **GRD** token between the **Quantova Network** and **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**. By utilizing state-of-the-art technologies, the bridge ensures asset security and decentralization while enabling cross-chain interoperability.

The bridge now leverages **GrandpaFinality Proofs** for ensuring trustless validation of transactions on the Quantova side and integrates **RISC Zero** zero-knowledge proofs for off-chain verification. This allows for reduced on-chain computational overhead while maintaining high security.

### Key Features

- **Asset Security**: 1:1 peg between **GRD** and **wrapped GRD (wGRD)** via collateralization.
- **Decentralized Validation**: The use of **GrandpaFinality Proofs** and a **2/3 quorum consensus** ensures transaction validity.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: Supports transfers between **Quantova Network** and **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**, enabling interaction between two blockchains.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Using **RISC Zero** to validate transaction finality off-chain, reducing on-chain load.

## How the Bridge Works

### 1. Transfer GRD → BSC (Lock-and-Mint)

#### User Initiates Transfer:

- The user sends **GRD** to the bridge contract on the **Quantova Network**.

#### Lock GRD:

The bridge locks the **GRD** tokens and emits an event containing:

- Sender’s address
- Locked amount
- Destination chain (BSC)
- Unique transaction ID

#### Relayer Monitoring:

Relayers monitor the lock event and validate:

- The correct amount locked.
- Transaction finality (irreversibility).
- Validation using **GrandpaFinality Proofs** for secure transaction verification.

#### Quorum Consensus:

At least **2/3 of the relayers** must cryptographically sign a validity proof.

#### Mint wGRD on BSC:

- The **BSC bridge contract** verifies the relayers’ proof using **RISC Zero zero-knowledge proofs**.
- The equivalent **wGRD tokens** are minted on BSC and transferred to the user’s BSC address.

---

### 2. Transfer BSC → Quantova (Burn-and-Unlock)

#### User Initiates Transfer:

- The user sends **wGRD** to the bridge contract on **BSC**.

#### Relayer Monitoring:

Relayers verify that the burn event corresponds to a prior mint and validate using **GrandpaFinality Proofs**.

#### Quorum Consensus:

2/3 of relayers approve the unlock request.

#### Unlock GRD on Quantova:

- The **Quantova bridge** verifies the relayers’ proof.
- The original **GRD** tokens are unlocked and sent to the user’s **Quantova address**.

## Relayer Responsibilities

Relayers are trusted validators ensuring cross-chain transaction integrity:

| Role                       | Details                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event Monitoring**       | Track lock, mint, burn, and unlock events on both chains.               |
| **Transaction Validation** | Verify transaction legitimacy (amount, finality, destination).          |
| **Quorum Signing**         | Submit cryptographic signatures only after **2/3 consensus**.          |
| **Security Enforcement**   | Malicious/inactive relayers are slashed (penalized) via governance.     |

---

## Security Mechanisms

### 1. **2/3 Quorum Consensus**

Transactions require approval from **≥67% of relayers** to prevent single points of failure.

Example: With 9 relayers, at least 6 must sign each transaction.

### 2. **Finality Checks**

Relayers confirm transactions are irreversible (e.g., Quantova blocks are finalized) using **GrandpaFinality Proofs**.

### 3. **Governance Oversight**

#### Relayer Slashing:
- **Malicious Activity**: Submitting fraudulent proofs → stake slashed.
- **Inactivity**: Missing more than **10% of transactions** → replaced by governance.

## Technical Integration

### Smart Contracts

- **Quantova Bridge Contract**: Manages locking/unlocking **GRD** on the Quantova Network.
- **BSC Bridge Contract**: Handles minting/burning **wGRD** tokens on **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**.

### Relayer Infrastructure

- **Automated Watchdogs**: Relayers monitor both chains 24/7 for bridge events.
- **Threshold Signatures**: Multi-party computation (MPC) is used for quorum approvals.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs with RISC Zero

- **GrandpaFinality Proofs**: Proofs from the Quantova Network are used for verifying finality.
- **RISC Zero**: Off-chain ZK proof generation ensures minimal on-chain computational overhead.

## How the Bridge Works (Detailed)

### 1. Initiating a Transfer (Quantova → BSC)

- The user sends **GRD** to the bridge on **Quantova Network**.
- The bridge locks the **GRD** and emits an event containing:
    - The sender’s address
    - The amount locked
    - The destination chain (**BSC**)
    - A unique transaction ID
- Relayers monitor the blockchain for this event.

### 2. Relayer Verification & Quorum Consensus

- Each relayer independently verifies the transaction to ensure:
    - The correct amount of **GRD** is locked.
    - The amount and destination match the request.
    - The transaction has finality and is not reversible, validated by **GrandpaFinality Proofs**.
- Once **2/3** of the relayers reach consensus, they sign a proof confirming the transaction.
- The signed proof is then submitted to the bridge contract on **BSC**.

### 3. Minting Wrapped GRD on BSC

- The **BSC bridge contract** receives the proof from relayers.
- It verifies that the proof meets the **2/3 quorum requirement**.
- Once verified, the contract mints equivalent **wGRD** tokens on **BSC**.
- The user receives **wGRD** on their **BSC** wallet.

### 4. How the Bridge Works in Reverse (BSC → Quantova)

#### 1. Initiating a Transfer (BSC → Quantova)

- The user sends **wGRD** to the bridge contract on **BSC**.
- The contract burns the **wGRD** and emits an event containing:
    - The sender’s address
    - The amount burned
    - The destination chain (**Quantova**)
    - A unique transaction ID
- Relayers detect the burn event.

#### 2. Relayer Verification & Quorum Consensus

- Relayers verify that:
    - The burn event is valid and corresponds to a previous mint event.
    - The amount and destination are correct.
    - The transaction is finalized and validated by **GrandpaFinality Proofs**.
- Once **2/3** of relayers approve, they sign a proof and submit it to the bridge on **Quantova**.

#### 3. Unlocking GRD on Quantova

- The **Quantova bridge** receives the proof.
- It verifies that at least **2/3** of the relayers signed the proof.
- Once validated, the bridge unlocks the original **GRD** and sends it back to the user.

## Conclusion

The **Quantova Bridge** now combines enhanced security (using **GrandpaFinality Proofs**), decentralization (via a relayer network), and efficient **zero-knowledge proofs** (RISC Zero) to enable seamless and secure cross-chain transfers. This solution minimizes on-chain computational overhead while maintaining high standards for transaction integrity and asset security.
