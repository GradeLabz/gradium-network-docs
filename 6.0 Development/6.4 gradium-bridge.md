# Gradium Network Bridge

## Secure Cross-Chain Transfer of GRD Tokens

The Gradium Network Bridge enables seamless transfer of the native GRD token between the Gradium Network and Binance
Smart Chain (BSC). It ensures asset security through a lock-and-mint / burn-and-unlock mechanism, preventing duplication
of GRD across chains. The bridge operates as a core component of the Gradium blockchain, secured by decentralized
relayers and quorum consensus.

## Key Features

- **Asset Security:** 1:1 peg between GRD and wrapped GRD (wGRD) via collateralization.
- **Decentralized Validation:** Relayers enforce 2/3 quorum consensus for transaction approval.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** Supports transfers between Gradium and BSC.

## How the Bridge Works

### 1. Transfer GRD → BSC (Lock-and-Mint)

#### User Initiates Transfer:

- Send GRD to the bridge contract on Gradium Network.

#### Lock GRD:

The bridge locks the GRD tokens and emits an event with:

- Sender’s address
- Locked amount
- Destination chain (BSC)
- Unique transaction ID

#### Relayer Monitoring:

Relayers detect the lock event and validate:

- Correct amount locked.
- Transaction finality (irreversibility).

#### Quorum Consensus:

At least 2/3 of relayers must cryptographically sign a validity proof.

#### Mint wGRD on BSC:

- The BSC bridge contract verifies the relayers’ proof.
- Mints equivalent wGRD tokens to the user’s BSC address.

### 2. Transfer BSC → Gradium (Burn-and-Unlock)

#### User Initiates Transfer:

- Send wGRD to the bridge contract on BSC.

#### Burn wGRD:

The bridge burns wGRD tokens and emits an event with:

- Sender’s address
- Burned amount
- Destination chain (Gradium)
- Unique transaction ID

#### Relayer Monitoring:

Relayers verify the burn event corresponds to a prior mint.

#### Quorum Consensus:

2/3 of relayers approve the unlock request.

#### Unlock GRD on Gradium:

- The Gradium bridge verifies the relayers’ proof.
- Releases the original GRD tokens to the user’s Gradium address.

## Relayer Responsibilities

Relayers are trusted validators ensuring cross-chain transaction integrity:

| Role                       | Details                                                                    |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Event Monitoring**       | Track lock, mint, burn, and unlock events on both chains.                  |
| **Transaction Validation** | Verify transaction legitimacy (amount, finality, destination).             |
| **Quorum Signing**         | Submit cryptographic signatures only after 2/3 consensus.                  |
| **Security Enforcement**   | Malicious/inactive relayers are slashed (penalized) via governance. |

## Security Mechanisms

### 1. 2/3 Quorum Consensus

Transactions require approval from ≥67% of relayers to prevent single points of failure.

Example: With 9 relayers, at least 6 must sign each transaction.

### 2. Finality Checks

Relayers confirm transactions are irreversible (e.g., Gradium blocks are finalized).

### 3. Governance Oversight

#### Relayer slashing:

- **Malicious Activity:** Submit fraudulent proofs → stake slashed.
- **Inactivity:** Miss >10% of transactions → replaced by governance.

## Technical Integration

### Smart Contracts

- **Gradium Bridge Contract:** Manages locking/unlocking GRD.
- **BSC Bridge Contract:** Handles minting/burning wGRD.

### Relayer Infrastructure

- **Automated Watchdogs:** Monitor chains 24/7 for bridge events.
- **Threshold Signatures:** Use multi-party computation (MPC) for quorum approvals.

## User Guide

### Transfer GRD to BSC

1. **Connect Wallet:** Use MetaMask or Gradium Wallet.
2. **Select Amount:** Enter GRD to transfer.
3. **Confirm Lock:** Sign the transaction on Gradium.
4. **Receive wGRD:** Tokens arrive on BSC in ~5-10 minutes.

### Transfer wGRD to Gradium

1. **Connect BSC Wallet:** Use MetaMask (BSC network).
2. **Select Amount:** Enter wGRD to burn.
3. **Confirm Burn:** Sign the transaction on BSC.
4. **Receive GRD:** Tokens arrive on Gradium in ~5-10 minutes.

## How the Bridge Works (Detailed)

### 1. Initiating a Transfer (Gradium → BSC)

- A user sends GRD to the bridge on Gradium Network.
- The bridge locks the GRD and emits an event containing:
    - The sender’s address
    - The amount locked
    - The destination chain (BSC)
    - A unique transaction ID
- Relayers monitor the blockchain and detect this event.

### 2. Relayer Verification & Quorum Consensus

- Each relayer independently verifies the transaction to ensure:
    - The correct amount of GRD is locked.
    - The amount and destination match the request.
    - The transaction has finality and is not reversible.
- Once at least 2/3 of the relayers reach consensus, they sign a proof confirming the transaction.
- The signed proof is then submitted to the bridge contract on BSC.

### 3. Minting Wrapped GRD on BSC

- The BSC bridge contract receives the proof from relayers.
- It verifies that the proof meets the 2/3 quorum requirement.
- Once verified, the contract mints wrapped GRD (wGRD) on BSC equivalent to the locked amount on Gradium.
- The user receives wGRD on their BSC wallet.

## How the Bridge Works in Reverse (BSC → Gradium)

### 1. Initiating a Transfer (BSC → Gradium)

- The user sends wGRD to the bridge contract on BSC.
- The contract burns the wGRD and emits a similar event containing:
    - The sender’s address
    - The amount burned
    - The destination chain (Gradium)
    - A unique transaction ID
- Relayers detect the burn event.

### 2. Relayer Verification & Quorum Consensus

- Relayers verify that:
    - The burn event is valid and corresponds to a previous mint event.
    - The amount and destination are correct.
    - The transaction is finalized.
- Once 2/3 of relayers approve, they sign a proof and submit it to the bridge on Gradium.

### 3. Unlocking GRD on Gradium

- The Gradium bridge receives the proof.
- It verifies that at least 2/3 of the relayers signed the proof.
- Once validated, the bridge unlocks the original GRD and sends it back to the user.

## Conclusion

The Gradium Bridge combines security (quorum consensus), decentralization (relayer network), and efficiency (
lock-mint/burn-unlock) to enable seamless cross-chain transfers. By preventing asset duplication and enforcing strict
validation, it ensures GRD remains secure across ecosystems.
