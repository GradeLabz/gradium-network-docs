# [Gradium Network](https://Gradium.io): Introduction

## **Objective**

Gradium Network is designed to address the existential [threat posed by quantum computers to classical cryptographic
algorithms](#why-quantum-computing-threatens-classical-blockchains). Built on **Substrate**, it integrates 
[**post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives**](https://github.com/GradeLabz/gradium-network-docs/blob/main/3.0%20Security%20Layers/3.1%20cryptographic-primitives.md)
to ensure long-term security while maintaining high performance and decentralization. The goal is to create a
future-proof blockchain resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.

## **Quantum Threat Context**

### **Why Quantum Computing Threatens Classical Blockchains**

1. **Shor’s Algorithm**:
    - **Impact**: Efficiently solves integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems.
    - **Targets**:
        - **ECDSA**/RSA signatures (used in Bitcoin, Ethereum).
        - **Diffie-Hellman** key exchange (used in TLS, P2P networks).
    - **Risk**: Quantum computers could derive private keys from public keys, enabling forged transactions and consensus
      attacks.

2. **Grover’s Algorithm**:
    - **Impact**: Provides quadratic speedup for brute-force searches.
    - **Targets**:
        - **SHA-256** (reduces collision resistance from 128-bit to 64-bit).
        - **AES-128** (reduces effective security to 64-bit).
    - **Risk**: Weakens hash functions and symmetric encryption, compromising data integrity.

### **Urgency of Quantum Resistance**

- **Quantum Timeline**:
    - **NIST Predictions**: Large-scale quantum computers capable of breaking ECC/RSA may emerge by **2030-2040**.
    - **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)**: Adversaries could store encrypted data today and decrypt it later with
      quantum computers.

## **Technical Approach**

### **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**

- **Lattice-Based Cryptography**:
    - **CRYSTALS-Dilithium** and **Kyber** rely on the hardness of **Learning With Errors (LWE)** problems.
    - **FALCON** uses **NTRU lattices** for compact signatures.
- **Hash-Based Cryptography**:
    - **SPHINCS+** provides stateless signatures using SHA-3.
    - **KangarooTwelve** optimizes Merkle tree hashing for large datasets.

### **Substrate Framework Advantages**

1**Runtime Upgradability**: Deploy PQC upgrades without hard forks.
2**Interoperability**: Compatibility with Polkadot’s cross-chain messaging (XCMP).

## **Conclusion**

Gradium Network is engineered to preemptively address quantum threats by integrating **NIST-standardized PQC algorithms
** and leveraging Substrate’s flexibility. By combining lattice-based signatures, hash-based primitives, and
energy-efficient consensus, it achieves:

- **Quantum Resistance**: Immunity to Shor’s and Grover’s attacks.
- **Performance**: Optimized for low overhead (e.g., FALCON’s 666-byte signatures).
- **Sustainability**: Pure PoS consensus and deflationary tokenomics.
