## **Introduction**
This document outlines the technical architecture of a **Quantova Network** built using Substrate. 
The system replaces classical cryptographic algorithms with **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** to safeguard against 
quantum computing threats. Each component is designed to address vulnerabilities posed by algorithms like Shor’s and 
Grover’s while maintaining performance and usability.

## **Consensus Mechanism**
### Purpose
Ensure agreement among nodes on the blockchain’s state using quantum-resistant digital signatures for block validation.

### Algorithm: **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**
- **Why Used**:
    - Lattice-based signature scheme resistant to Shor’s Algorithm.
    - Security relies on the hardness of **Learning With Errors (LWE)** and **Short Integer Solution (SIS)** problems.
- **Workflow**:
    1. A block producer signs the block header with a private Dilithium key.
    2. Verifiers validate the signature using the corresponding public key.
    3. The signed block header includes a SHA-3 hash of the block content.
- **Technical Details**:  
  | Parameter          | Value       |  
  |--------------------|-------------|  
  | Public Key Size    | ~1 KB       |  
  | Signature Size     | ~2 KB       |  
  | Verification       | Matrix-vector multiplications (optimized for efficiency). |

## **Transaction Layer**
### Purpose
Ensure the integrity and authenticity of user transactions.

### Algorithm: **FALCON**
- **Why Used**:
    - NTRU lattice-based signatures with compact sizes and fast verification.
    - Resistant to quantum attacks targeting classical schemes (e.g., ECDSA).
- **Workflow**:
    1. Users sign transactions with private FALCON keys.
    2. Nodes validate signatures using public keys and re-hash data with SHA-3.
- **Technical Details**:  
  | Parameter          | Value       |  
  |--------------------|-------------|  
  | Public Key Size    | 897 bytes   |  
  | Signature Size     | 666 bytes   |  
  | Hash Function      | sha3-256 bit   |

## **Networking Layer**
### Purpose
Secure peer-to-peer communication between nodes.

### Algorithm: **Kyber**
- **Why Used**:
    - Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) resistant to quantum attacks.
    - Security relies on the **Module Learning With Errors (MLWE)** problem.
- **Implementation**:
    1. Nodes generate Kyber public/private key pairs.
    2. Shared secrets are derived via encapsulation/decapsulation.
    3. Communication is encrypted using **AES-256** in GCM mode.

## **Storage and State Management**
### Purpose
Maintain blockchain data integrity using quantum-resistant structures.

### Algorithm: **SPHINCS+**
- **Why Used**:
    - Stateless hash-based signature scheme for Merkle tree root verification.
    - Immune to quantum attacks due to reliance on SHA-3.
- **Merkle Tree Construction**:
    - Nodes hashed using **KangarooTwelve** (post-quantum hash function).
    - Root hash verified via SPHINCS+ signatures at each tree level.

    - **FALCON**: Compact signatures for transactions.
    - **CRYSTALS-Dilithium**: Block signing and consensus.

### Hash Functions
- **Post-Quantum Algorithms**:
    - **SHA-3**: 256+ bit outputs resist Grover’s Algorithm.
    - **KangarooTwelve**: High-speed hashing for large datasets.

---

## **Key Exchange Mechanisms**
### Algorithm: **Kyber**
- **Workflow**:
    1. Node A generates a Kyber key pair and shares the public key with Node B.
    2. Node B generates a ciphertext and shared secret using Node A’s public key.
    3. Node A decapsulates the ciphertext to derive the shared secret.

## **Governance and Economics**
### Algorithm: **Rainbow**
- **Why Used**:
    - Multivariate quadratic signature scheme resistant to quantum attacks.
- **Workflow**:
    - Stakeholders sign with Rainbow signatures.

- **Why Used**:
    - Replaces classical elliptic curve-based VRFs vulnerable to quantum attacks.
- **Implementation**:
    - SHA-3 generates entropy pools for leader election and lotteries.

---

## **Light Client Support**
### Algorithm: **Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)**
- **Why Used**:
    - Enables lightweight verification of blockchain state without full node resources.
- **Implementation**:
    - VDFs use post-quantum hash functions for delay-based integrity checks.

## **Attack Models and Mitigations**
### Shor’s Algorithm
- **Targets**: RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman.
- **Mitigation**: Replace with lattice/hash-based algorithms (e.g., Dilithium, Kyber).

### Grover’s Algorithm
- **Targets**: Symmetric keys and hash functions.
- **Mitigation**: Use **AES-256** and **SHA-3** (≥256-bit outputs).

## **Key Functionalities**
1. **Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**:
    - Validators selected based on staked tokens; energy-efficient and decentralized.
2. **Deflationary Tokenomics**:
    - Transaction fees burned to reduce token supply, incentivizing scarcity.
3. **Quantum-Resistant Transactions**:
    - FALCON ensures tamper-proof transactions against quantum adversaries.
4. **Secure Node Communication**:
    - Kyber establishes quantum-safe encrypted channels.
5. **Tamper-Proof Data Storage**:
