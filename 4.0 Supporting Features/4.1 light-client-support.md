# Quantum-Resistant Blockchain: Light Client Support

## **Purpose**

Light clients enable resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile wallets, IoT devices) to **securely verify blockchain
state** without storing the full chain. This is achieved using **Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)** and post-quantum
hash functions, ensuring lightweight yet quantum-resistant verification.

## **Why Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs)?**

### **Algorithm Overview**

- **Type**: Time-based cryptographic primitive requiring sequential computation.
- **Security Foundation**: Relies on **inherent sequentiality** – outputs cannot be computed faster than the delay time,
  even with quantum parallelism.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Immune to Grover’s/Shor’s attacks due to hash-based design.

### **Key Advantages**

- **Minimal Resource Usage**: Light clients verify proofs without heavy computation.
- **Unforgeable Proofs**: VDFs ensure proofs cannot be spoofed or precomputed.

## **Workflow: Light Client Verification**

### **Step 1: Block Header Request**

1. **Light Client Query**: Requests a block header and VDF proof from a full node.
2. **Proof Generation**: Full nodes generate a VDF proof using the block’s hash and a post-quantum hash function (e.g.,
   **SHA-3**).

### **Step 2: VDF Proof Verification**

1. **Proof Validation**:
    - The light client verifies the VDF proof against the block header.
2. **Proof Integrity**: Ensures the block was not forged or tampered with.
3. **Proof Authenticity**: Confirms the block’s origin and validity.

## Step 3: State Verification

### Merkle Proof Check

Light clients verify specific transactions/states using Merkle inclusion proofs anchored to the VDF-secured block
header.

| Parameter             | Value                |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **VDF Algorithm**     | Wesolowski VDF       |
| **Hash Function**     | SHA-3-256            |
| **Delay Time**        | 10 seconds per block |
| **Proof Size**        | 1 KB                 |
| **Verification Time** | <10 ms               |

### Light Client Storage

- **Header Chain**: Stores block headers with embedded VDF proofs.
- **Merkle Proof Cache**: Caches frequently accessed proofs (e.g., wallet balances).

## Security Considerations

### Quantum Resistance

- **SHA-3** ensures pre-image resistance against Grover’s algorithm.
- **VDF sequentiality** prevents quantum parallelism from accelerating proof generation.

### Proof Forgery

- Mitigated by requiring a minimum delay time (e.g., 10 seconds) for VDF computation.

### Sybil Attacks

- Light clients cross-verify proofs with multiple full nodes.

## Performance Comparison

| Method             | Resource Usage | Quantum Resistance | Verification Speed | Proof Size |
|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|
| **SPV (Bitcoin)**  | Low            | ❌                  | ~5 ms              | 80 bytes   |
| **VDF + SHA-3**    | Very Low       | ✅                  | ~10 ms             | 1 KB       |
| **Full Node Sync** | High           | ✅                  | N/A                | N/A        |

## Challenges and Mitigations

### VDF Computational Overhead

- **Mitigation**: Offload proof generation to dedicated nodes or cloud services.

### Delay Time Tuning

- **Mitigation**: Dynamically adjust delay time based on network latency and security requirements.

### Storage Constraints

- **Mitigation**: Use probabilistic sampling (e.g., skip non-critical blocks).

## Future-Proofing

- **Adaptive VDFs**: Adjust parameters based on quantum computing advancements.
- **ZK-VDF Hybrids**: Combine VDFs with zero-knowledge proofs (e.g., zk-SNARKs) for privacy-preserving verification.
- **NIST Compliance**: Adopt standardized VDF constructions post-NIST evaluation.
