# Networking Layer

## **Purpose**

The Gradium networking layer ensures [**secure peer-to-peer (P2P) communication**](#workflow-key-exchange-and-encrypted-communication) between nodes. It replaces classical
key exchange mechanisms (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, ECDH) with [**Kyber**](#algorithm-overview), a post-quantum Key
Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), to
establish [quantum-resistant](#quantum-resistance) shared secrets for encrypted communication.

## **Why Kyber?**

### **Algorithm Overview**

- **Type**: Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM).
- **Security Foundation**: Relies on the **Module Learning With Errors (MLWE)** problem, which is computationally hard
  for both classical and quantum computers.
- **NIST Standardization**: Selected as a **Round 3 finalist** (Category: Key Encapsulation) in the NIST Post-Quantum
  Cryptography Project.

### **Quantum Resistance**

- **Shor’s Algorithm Immunity**: MLWE problems cannot be solved efficiently by quantum computers.
- **Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key pairs ensure session keys are not compromised even if long-term keys are leaked.

## **Workflow: Key Exchange and Encrypted Communication**

### **Step 1: Key Pair Generation**

#### Node Initialization:

    - Each node generates a Kyber **public-private key pair** during startup.

### Step 2: Key Exchange

#### Public Key Sharing

- **Node A** sends its public key (`pk_A`) to **Node B**.

#### Encapsulation

- **Node B** generates a ciphertext (`ct`) and a shared secret (`ss_B`) using `pk_A`:

```rust
let (ct, ss_B) = pqcrypto_kyber::kyber512::encapsulate( & pk_A);
```

#### Ciphertext Transmission

- **Node B** sends `ct` to **Node A**.

### Step 3: Decapsulation

#### Shared Secret Derivation

- **Node A** uses its private key (`sk_A`) to decapsulate `ct` and derive the shared secret (`ss_A`):

```rust
let ss_A = pqcrypto_kyber::kyber512::decapsulate( & ct, & sk_A);
```

#### Session Symmetry

- `ss_A` and `ss_B` are identical, enabling secure communication.

### Step 4: Encrypted Communication

#### AES-256-GCM

- The shared secret (`ss_A`/`ss_B`) is used to derive AES-256 keys for encrypting P2P messages.

#### Session Lifespan

- Keys are rotated periodically (e.g., every 24 hours) to enhance security.

### Protocol Flow

      |— AES-256-GCM(ss_A) encrypted data —>|  
      |<— AES-256-GCM(ss_B) encrypted data —|
```

### Key Management

- Ephemeral keys are stored in-memory and discarded after session expiration.
- Long-term keys are encrypted using AES-256-GCM-SIV for storage.

- **MLWE Assumptions**: The best-known attacks require solving MLWE with complexity O(2^128) for Kyber-512.

- **Side-Channel Attacks**: Mitigated via constant-time implementations in the Kyber library.

- **Backward Compatibility**: Hybrid key exchange (Kyber + ECDH) during transition phases to support legacy nodes.

| Challenge          | Mitigation                                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Large Key Sizes    | Use key compression (e.g., storing seeds instead of full keys). |
| Bandwidth Overhead | Compress ciphertexts using DEFLATE before transmission.         |
