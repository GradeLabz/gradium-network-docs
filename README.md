# Quantum-Resistant Blockchain - Developer Documentation

Welcome to the official internal documentation repository for the **Quantum-Resistant Blockchain** project.
This repository serves as the central hub for all technical documentation, guides, and
resources needed by developers to understand, build, and contribute to the project.

---

## **Project Overview**

The **Quantum-Resistant Blockchain** is a next-generation blockchain platform designed to address the emerging threats
posed by quantum computing.
Traditional blockchains rely on cryptographic algorithms (e.g., ECDSA, RSA) that are vulnerable to quantum attacks,
such as **Shor's Algorithm** (which breaks public-key cryptography) and
**Grover's Algorithm** (which weakens symmetric-key cryptography). This project integrates
**post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms** to ensure long-term security and resilience against quantum computing
threats.

## **Key Features**

1. **Quantum-Resistant Consensus**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium ensures secure block validation in a PoS model.
2. **Secure Transactions**: FALCON enables compact, quantum-resistant transaction signatures.
3. **Quantum-Safe Networking**: Kyber secures node communication via post-quantum key exchange.
4. **Tamper-Proof Storage**: SPHINCS+ and KangarooTwelve protect Merkle tree integrity.
5. **Light Client Support**: VDFs allow lightweight, quantum-safe state verification.
6. **Governance & Voting**: Rainbow signatures secure stakeholder decision-making.
7. **Fair Randomness Generation**: SHA-3 powers tamper-proof entropy for critical processes.
8. **Pure Proof-of-Stake**: Energy-efficient consensus with staked validators.
9. **Deflationary Tokenomics**: Transaction fee burning reduces token supply over time.
10. **Quantum Attack Mitigations**: SHA-3 and AES-256 counter Shor’s and Grover’s threats.
